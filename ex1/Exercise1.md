# Exercise 1 - Linear regression    

### Introduction  

In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it work on data.  

### Files included in this exercise

* ex1.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through the exercise 
* ex1 multi.m - Octave/MATLAB script for the later parts of the exercise 
* ex1data1.txt - Dataset for linear regression with one variable 
* ex1data2.txt - Dataset for linear regression with multiple variables 
* [*] warmUpExercise.m - Simple example function in Octave/MATLAB 
* [*] plotData.m - Function to display the dataset 
* [*] computeCost.m - Function to compute the cost of linear regression 
* [*] gradientDescent.m - Function to run gradient descent 
* [†] computeCostMulti.m - Cost function for multiple variables 
* [†] gradientDescentMulti.m - Gradient descent for multiple variables 
* [†] featureNormalize.m - Function to normalize features 
* [†] normalEqn.m - Function to compute the normal equations

[*] indicates ﬁles you will need to complete [†] indicates optional exercises

Throughout the exercise, you will be using the scripts ex1.m and ex1 multi.m. These scripts set up the dataset for the problems and make calls to functions that you will write. You do not need to modify either of them. You are only required to modify functions in other ﬁles, by following the instructions in this assignment.   
For this programming exercise, you are only required to complete the ﬁrst part of the exercise to implement linear regression with one variable. The second part of the exercise, which is optional, covers linear regression with multiple variables.
